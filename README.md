A description of the project 2

I have been working on the project 2 of Treehouse in the TD program in which 
I have learned about a pagination web development technique; in which it consisted 
of displaying 10 students on each webpage and building a navigation system on the botttom 
of the page in order to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time.
